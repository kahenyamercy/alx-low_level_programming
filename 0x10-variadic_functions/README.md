Variadic Functions in C Programming

Variadic functions are functions that can accept a variable number of arguments. In C programming, variadic functions are implemented using the stdarg.h header file.

The most commonly used variadic function in C programming is printf(), which is used to print formatted output. This function can accept a variable number of arguments depending on the format string provided.

To create a variadic function, you need to declare it with an ellipsis (...) in the argument list. The stdarg.h header file provides macros that allow you to access the variable arguments passed to the function.

The three main macros provided by stdarg.h are:

#1. va_start: This macro initializes a va_list object that allows you to access the variable arguments passed to the function.

#2. va_arg: This macro retrieves the next argument from the va_list object.

#3. va_end: This macro cleans up the va_list object after you're done accessing the variable arguments.
