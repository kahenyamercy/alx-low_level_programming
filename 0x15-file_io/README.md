FILE I/O

File I/O allows programs to read from and write to files on disk. This is a critical component of many software systems, enabling applications to store and retrieve data for later use.


To work with files in a program, you typically need to use the open, close, read, and write system calls. These allow you to create new files, open existing ones, read data from them, and write new data to them.

When working with files, it's important to understand file permissions, which determine who can access and modify a file. You can set file permissions when creating a new file using the open system call.

With the right knowledge of file I/O and system calls, you can build powerful software that can read, write, and manipulate files on disk with ease.
