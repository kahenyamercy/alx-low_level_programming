Functions and Nested Loops
Welcome to the "functions_nested_loops" directory! This directory contains code examples and exercises related to functions and nested loops in programming.

Description
In this directory, you will find various code snippets and examples that demonstrate the use of functions and nested loops. Functions are an essential component of modular programming, allowing us to encapsulate reusable code blocks. On the other hand, nested loops provide a powerful way to repeat actions and perform iterative tasks.
